🌐 Personal Blog Website

This project is a modern, mobile-responsive  blog website designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes multiple sample blog posts, visual cards, a hero banner, smooth UI animations, and a fully functional comment system. Every post supports comments stored securely in the browser using localStorage, allowing users to interact without requiring a backend server.
The design is clean, minimal, and suitable for portfolios or as a starter blog template.
